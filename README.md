# scripts
=======

## Intro

This is a complete and utter f*#@ing mess right now.

In the future, this will be a repo to hold my collection
of scripts snippets and functions etc. to facilitate
reusable code.

As time permits, I also want to provide some clear and
well explained comments so that anyone wishing to use
anything here completely understands what each line
is doing.  This should help both you and I to grow.
